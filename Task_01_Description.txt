House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
Description:
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on three key features: square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The steps covered in this notebook include:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Introduction of a synthetic dataset representing house features and their corresponding prices.
Overview of the data structure and basic statistics.
Data Preparation:

Separation of the dataset into features (SquareFootage, Bedrooms, Bathrooms) and the target variable (Price).
Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Training:

Implementation of a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Training the model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Predicting house prices using the test data.
Calculation of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to evaluate model performance.
Model Interpretation:

Examination of the model's coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on house prices.
