Description: Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

This project applies a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history, 
specifically focusing on their annual income and spending score. By analyzing these key features, the model groups customers 
into distinct clusters, each representing a unique customer segment with similar purchasing behaviors.

Purpose:
Customer Segmentation: The primary objective is to identify and group customers into meaningful segments that reflect their
 purchasing patterns and financial capacity. This segmentation enables the retail store to develop tailored marketing strategies 
 and personalized offers for each customer group.

Business Insights: The model provides valuable insights into customer behavior, helping the store understand how different 
segments of customers interact with its products and services. This information can guide strategic decisions related to 
inventory management, pricing, and promotional efforts.

Resource Optimization: By targeting specific customer segments, the store can optimize the allocation of resources, ensuring 
that marketing efforts, stock, and staff are aligned with the needs of the most profitable customer groups. This can lead to 
increased efficiency and higher customer satisfaction.

Features:
Data Standardization: The model standardizes the selected features (annual income and spending score) to ensure that all data 
points contribute equally to the clustering process.

Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters: The Elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring that the model 
effectively captures the natural grouping of customers without overfitting.

Cluster Analysis: The model calculates the mean values of the features for each cluster, allowing for a detailed analysis of the
 characteristics that define each customer segment.

PCA Visualization: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize the clusters 
in a 2D space, making it easier to interpret the results and understand the separation between different customer groups.

Outcome:
This customer segmentation model provides the retail store with actionable insights into customer behavior, enabling the development of 
targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer experiences. By leveraging these insights, the store can enhance customer satisfaction, improve resource allocation, and ultimately drive business growth.
